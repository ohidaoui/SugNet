Implementing a U-Net based convnet for sugar beets crop/weeds detection

## Understanding the data
The data used to train the model is a realistic synthetic dataset of 360x480 sugar beets crop/weeds images with corresponding annotations generated for selective weeding tasks (Accurately detect plants and distinguish them between crop and weeds) in agriculture robotics as having large agricultural datasets with pixel-level annotations is an extremely time consuming.
The dataset and the related work can be found [here](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it//~labrococo/fds/syntheticdatasets.html).
> Only **Synthetic SugarBeet Random Weeds** dataset is used for this task.
